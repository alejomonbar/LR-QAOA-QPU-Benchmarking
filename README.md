## Evaluating the performance of quantum process units at large width and depth

In this work, we use LR-QAOA protocol [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09169) as an easy-to-implement scalable benchmarking methodology that assesses quantum process units (QPUs) at different widths (number of qubits) and 2-qubit gate depths.
